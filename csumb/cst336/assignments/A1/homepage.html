                <p><span>Hi<b><i>!</i></b></span> My name is Vanessa Ulloa, I a 24 years old from Southern California. I live near Six Flags Magic Mountain, so stop on by and ride the roller-coasters. I have been programming since I was 16 and started with Basic Web Programming and Design. My first major was Web Design so I spent a lot of time learning Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and a littile bit of InDesign. However, I realized that I was far more interested in what happened behind the scenes of a website.  </p>
                <p>So, I began taking courses in Computer Science because it was a subject I truely enjoyed. I still switched my major from Web Design to Mathematics to History and finally to Computer Science. I am very happy to be a part of this program, for the past few years I have been applying to school but could not attend for one reason or another. It his hard to find a school that is affordable and has the classes you need to graduate in a timely manner. </p>
<p>I currently work as a Systems Analyst for a Medical Device Manufacturing Company and while I do enjoy my job, I would much rather be on the other side of the table and on the software development team. However, I am glad for this experience and perspective because I know it will help me as a Software Engineer in the future. I a little Guitar, Bass Guitar and a little Ukelele.</p>
